# Segway-Reverted-Pendulum
Segway simulation created in UDK that presents the pshysics of reverted pendulum. Assets used for it, and a template for code was provided by my lecturer, so I am not able to share it.
But the code that orechstrate movement and physics of segway was created by me. Additionally I p0rovide documentation that shows the thinking path,
and describes in detail how it work. Assets,video and documentation can be provided on request, as it's bigeer than 25MB.
